# Installation Guide

This guide outlines the steps to set up and run this Django project locally.

## Prerequisites

* **Python:** Ensure you have Python installed (version 3.6 or higher is recommended). You can download it from the official Python website: https://www.python.org/downloads/
* **pip:** pip is the package installer for Python. It usually comes bundled with Python. You can verify its installation by running:

```bash
pip --version
# or
pip3 --version
```

## Installation Steps

### 1. Clone the Repository

Open your terminal or command prompt and clone the project repository using Git:

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
```

Replace `<repository_url>` with the actual URL of this GitHub repository.

### 2. Navigate to the Project Directory

Change your current directory to the root of the project folder:

```bash
cd your_project_directory
```

Replace `your_project_directory` with the name of the folder created after cloning.

### 3. Create a Virtual Environment

It's highly recommended to create a virtual environment to manage project dependencies separately.

* **Using `venv`** (recommended for Python 3.3+):

```bash
python -m venv env
# or
python3 -m venv env
```

This creates a directory named `env` (you can choose a different name if you prefer) in your project's root directory.

* **Using `virtualenv`** (if you prefer or have an older Python version):

```bash
pip install virtualenv
virtualenv env
# or
pip3 install virtualenv
virtualenv env
```

### 4. Activate the Virtual Environment

Activate the virtual environment to use its isolated Python environment.

* **On macOS and Linux:**

```bash
source env/bin/activate
```

* **On Windows (Command Prompt):**

```bash
env\Scripts\activate.bat
```

* **On Windows (PowerShell):**

```bash
.\env\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

You should see the name of your virtual environment (e.g., `(env)`) at the beginning of your terminal prompt when it's active.

### 5. Install Dependencies

Install the project's dependencies using pip and the requirements.txt file. If you don't have a requirements.txt, you'll need to install Django and any other required packages manually.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

*(If you don't have `requirements.txt`, run `pip install Django` and any other necessary packages)*

### 6. Configure the Database

Open the `settings.py` file in your project's main directory (`your_project_directory/your_project/settings.py`) and configure the `DATABASES` setting. The default SQLite setup usually works out-of-the-box for development. If you are using a different database (like PostgreSQL or MySQL), update the `ENGINE`, `NAME`, `USER`, `PASSWORD`, `HOST`, and `PORT` settings accordingly.

### 7. Run Database Migrations

Apply the database migrations to create the necessary tables in your database.

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

### 8. Create a Superuser (Admin Account)

Create an administrator account to access the Django administration site.

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

Follow the prompts to set up your admin username, email, and password.

### 9. Run the Development Server

Start the Django development server to run your project locally.

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

The server will typically start at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.

### 10. Access the Application

Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` to view your project's homepage.
You can access the admin site at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/` using the superuser credentials you created.

## Additional Notes

* If you make changes to your models, remember to run `python manage.py makemigrations` and `python manage.py migrate` to update your database schema.
* For deploying to production, additional steps are required (e.g., configuring a production database, setting up a web server like Gunicorn or uWSGI, using a production-ready static file setup).
